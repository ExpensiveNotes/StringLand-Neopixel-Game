# StringLand-Neopixel-Game
  StringLand is a 1D Neopixel Game with an extra "sideways" dimension. These extra dimensions are not all visible at once.
  
  Written by John Melki-Wegner aka "Expensive Notes" with an Arduino UNO clone, 4 buttons and a 120 NeoPixel string
  
  Aim: To score as much as possible before your island is invaded by the nasty invaders (red pixels). 
  
  Island: Your Island is the yellow pixels in the middle of string land. It is surrounded by blue sea.
  
  You: You are the Green Pixel which you can move up and down the visible string via buttons 
  
  Score: Each time you touch a Nasty (red pixel) you score a point and the red pixels are banished to the end of the string world. The white pixel is your score.
  
  Dimensions: To change dimension to a different 1D string press the other two buttons. Your current dimension is shown by the black pixel on your island.
  
  Hardware needed: Arduino Uno, Neopixel string (I used a 120 length string) and 4 buttons.
